- [x] Code 2 :  
Define a program to find out whether a given number is even or odd.

- [x] Code 3 :  
A person is eligible to vote if his/her age is greater than or equal to 18. Define a method to find out if he/she is eligible to vote.

- [x] Code 4 :

51-60          CD 
41-50          DD 
<=40          Fail 
</pre>

- [x] Code 9 :  
Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'. Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * .... * (n-1) *n. E.g.-
<pre>
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 
2! = 2 * 1 = 2 
Also, 
1! = 1 
0! = 1
</pre>

Write a function that returns all prime numbers between two given numbers.

- [x] Code 14 :  
Write a function that returns the sum of first n natural numbers.
